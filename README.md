## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
**APP 1** - Pinterest
- [ ] Touch gestures and button placement
- [ ] Color palette used for the interface

**APP 2** - Snapchat
- [ ] Easy feature location with swipes and taps
- [ ] Filters are fun to use
- [ ] Saving pictures

**APP 3** - Instagram
- [ ] Innovative looking buttons
- [ ] Color schemes for the UI are also unique

**Preliminary App Idea** : Landlord Rating App

This app will have profiles for different landlords and rating based on different aspects ranging from their attention to 
maintenance issues or their demeanor towards the tenants. I aim for the app to help individuals decide on renting houses/apartments
not just based on amenities but also the services being provided for the property.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

ANS: The Xcode setup and interface was very new to me, but exploring it was interesting. Mostly finding the files in the 
folder structure was pretty challenging. Learning Swift is also going to be a new facet to my skillset but excited to learn further through the course.
